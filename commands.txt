Training of the NLU model didn't change much from the way it was shown in the video. To train and test the model run:

Training the NLU model
    python nlu_model.py

Training the Rasa Core model
The biggest change in how Rasa Core model works is that custom action 'action_weather' now needs to run on a separate server. That server has to be configured in a 'endpoints.yml' file. This is how to train and run the dialogue management model:

Start the custom action server by running:
    python -m rasa_core_sdk.endpoint --actions actions

Open a new terminal and train the Rasa Core model by running:
    python dialogue_management_model.py

Talk to the chatbot once it's loaded.
Starting the interactive training session:
The process of running the interactive session is very similar to training the Rasa Core model:

Make sure the custom actions server is running:
    python -m rasa_core_sdk.endpoint --actions actions

Start the interactive training session by running:
    python train_interactive.py
